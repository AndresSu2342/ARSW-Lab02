# snake-race-thread-concurrency
A variation of the popular game Snake using multi-snake threads moving against things to practice concurrency

Project made during 2nd Year of graduation for the class - Distributive & Concurrent Programming

## Instructions

You don't need to do anything, just watch snakes randomly battling against each other.

If you want to control a snake just Mouse-Right-Click it to select and Mouse-Left-Click in a Cell to make her move to its destiny.

Detailed instruction can be found in 'The Snake Race - Instrucoes.docx' & 'The Snake Race - Relatorio.docx' (both in Portuguese)
## How to run

/SnakeRace/src/snakepackage/SnakeApp.java is where the main method is. 



### Left to do

Need to refactor the code, many parts are messy. It works but it isn't very effective.

More documentation & comments to ease cleaning code.

Some OOP rules (Visibility/Encapsulation) are not being followed because it wasn't the focus on this subject, I should fix that.
